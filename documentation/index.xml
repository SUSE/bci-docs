These images share the common SLES base, and none of them ship with a specific language or an application stack. All images feature the RPM database (even if the specific image does not include the RPM package manager) that can be used to verify the provenance of every file in the image.</description></item><item><title>Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>/documentation/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/documentation/faq/</guid><description>What? What has SUSE announced? SUSE Base Container Images (BCI) provides a repository of tested and certified container images based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The container images are ready-to-go for enterprise use. SUSE maintains these images on a regular basis so you can use them worry-free. The images are updated with the latest security patches and features/functionalities are consistent with the base OS releases.
With Rancher 2.6, SUSE has announced full integration between Rancher and BCI while ensuring the latest security standards.</description></item><item><title>Language stack SLE Base Container Images</title><link>/documentation/language-stack-bci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/documentation/language-stack-bci/</guid><description>If you have a working knowledge of containers, you will not have any difficulties using SLE BCIs. However, there are certain features that set SLE BCIs apart from similar offerings, like images based on Debian or Alpine Linux. And understanding the specifics can help you to get the most out of SLE BCIs in the shortest time possible.
Language stack SLE BCIs Language stack SLE BCI are built on top of BCI-Base.</description></item><item><title>Why SLE Base Container Images</title><link>/documentation/why-sle-bci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/documentation/why-sle-bci/</guid><description>SLE BCIs offer a platform for creating SLE-based custom container images and containerized applications that can be distributed freely. SLE BCIs feature the same predictable enterprise lifecycle as SLES. The SLE_BCI 15 SP3 and SP4 repository (which is a subset of the SLE repository) gives SLE BCIs access to 4,000 packages available for the AMD64/Intel 64, AArch64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures. The packages in the repository have undergone quality assurance and security audits by SUSE.</description></item></channel></rss>
