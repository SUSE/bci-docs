&lt;p>SUSE offers several general-purpose SLE Base Container Images that are
intended as deployment targets or as foundations for creating customized
images: BCI-Base, BCI-Minimal, BCI-Micro, and BCI-BusyBox. These images
share the common SLES base, and none of them ship with a specific
language or an application stack. All images feature the RPM database
(even if the specific image does not include the RPM package manager)
that can be used to verify the provenance of every file in the image.
Each image includes the SLES certificate bundle, which allows the
deployed applications to use the systemâ€™s certificates to verify TLS
connections.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SUSE Base Container Images (BCI) provides a repository of tested and
certified container images based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The
container images are ready-to-go for enterprise use. SUSE maintains
these images on a regular basis so you can use them worry-free. The
images are updated with the latest security patches and
features/functionalities are consistent with the base OS releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>With Rancher 2.6, SUSE has announced full integration between Rancher
and BCI while ensuring the latest security standards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you have a working knowledge of containers, you will not have any
difficulties using SLE BCIs. However, there are certain features that
set SLE BCIs apart from similar offerings, like images based on Debian
or Alpine Linux. And understanding the specifics can help you to get the
most out of SLE BCIs in the shortest time possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SLE BCIs offer a platform for creating SLE-based custom container images
and containerized applications that can be distributed freely. SLE BCIs
feature the same predictable enterprise lifecycle as SLES. The &lt;code>SLE_BCI&lt;/code>
15 SP3 and SP4 repository (which is a subset of the SLE repository)
gives SLE BCIs access to 4,000 packages available for the AMD64/Intel
64, AArch64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures. The packages in the
repository have undergone quality assurance and security audits by SUSE.
The container images are FIPS-compliant when running on a host in FIPS
mode. In addition to that, SUSE can provide official support for SLE
BCIs through SUSE subscription plans.&lt;/p>
