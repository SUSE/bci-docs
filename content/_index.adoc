title: Introduction to SLE Base Container Images
---

SLE Base Container Image (SLE BCI) are minimal SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server 15-based images that you can use to develop, deploy, and share
applications. There are two types of SLE BCI:

* General-purpose SLE BCI can be used for building custom container
images and for deploying applications.
* Language stack SLE BCI provide environments for developing and
deploying applications in specific programming languages.

In addition to that, we will provide Application Container Images based
on SLE BCI featuring popular containerized applications like Nginx,
PostgreSQL, MariaDB and https://github.com/SUSE/rmt[RMT].

== Highlights

* SLE BCI are fully compatible with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, but
they do not require a subscription to run and distribute them.
* SLE BCI automatically run in FIPS-compatible mode when the host
operating system is running in FIPS mode.
* Each SLE BCI includes the RPM database, which makes it possible to
audit the contents of the container image. You can use the RPM database
to determine the specific version of the RPM package any given file
belongs to. This allows you to ensure that a container image is not
susceptible to known and already fixed vulnerabilities.
* All SLE BCI (except for those without `zypper`) come with the
`container-suseconnect` service. This gives containers that run on a
registered SLES host access to the full SLES repositories.
`container-suseconnect` is invoked automatically when you run `zypper`
for the first time, and the service adds the correct SLES repositories
into the running container. On an unregistered SLES host or on a
non-SLES host, the service does nothing.

=== General-purpose SLE BCI

There are four general purpose SLE BCI, and each container image comes
with a minimum set of packages to keep its size low. You can use a
general purpose SLE BCI either as a starting point for building custom
container images, or as a platform for deploying specific
software. For more information about general purpose SLE BCI, see
link:{{< relref "documentation/general-purpose-bci.adoc" >}}[here].


=== Language stack SLE BCI

Language stack SLE BCI are built on top of the BCI-Base
general-purpose SLE BCI. Each container image comes with the zypper
stack and the free `SLE_BCI` repository. Additionally, each image
includes most common tools for building and deploying applications in
the specific language environment. This includes tools like a compiler
or interpreter as well as the language specific package manager. For
more information about language stack SLE BCI, see
link:{{< relref "documentation/language-stack-bci.adoc" >}}[here].

=== Important note on status and lifecycle

All container images, except for `bci-base`, are currently classified as
tech preview, and SUSE doesn't provide official support for them. This
information is visible on the web on
https://registry.suse.com[registry.suse.com]. In addition to that, it is
also indicated via the `com.suse.supportlevel` label whether a container
image still has the tech preview status. You can use the
https://github.com/containers/skopeo[`skopeo`] and
https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] utilities to check the status of
the desired SLE BCI as follows:

[source,ShellSession]
----
❯ skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-micro:15.4 | jq '.Labels["com.suse.supportlevel"]'
"techpreview"

❯ skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 | jq '.Labels["com.suse.supportlevel"]'
"l3"
----

In the example above, the `com.suse.supportlevel` label is set to
`techpreview` in the `bci-micro` container image, indicating that the
image still has the tech preview status. The `bci-base` container image
on the other hand is fully l3 supported. Unlike like the general purpose
SLE BCI, the language stack SLE BCI may not follow the lifecycle of the
SLE distribution: they are supported as long as the respective language
stack receives support. In other words, new versions of SLE BCI
(indicated by the OCI tags) may be released during the lifecycle of a
SLE Service Pack, while older versions may become unsupported. Refer to
https://suse.com/lifecycle[suse.com/lifecycle] to find out whether the
container in question is still under support.

=== Getting started

The SLE BCI are available as OCI-compatible container images directly
from registry.suse.com and can be used like any other container image.
For example, using one of the general purpose containers:

{{< tabs "run_sle_bci">}} {{< tab "Docker">}}

[source,ShellSession]
----
❯ docker run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep '^NAME' /etc/os-release
NAME="SLES"
----

{{< /tab >}} {{< tab "Podman" >}}

[source,ShellSession]
----
❯ podman run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep '^NAME' /etc/os-release
NAME="SLES"
----

{{< /tab >}} {{< tab "nerdctl" >}}

[source,ShellSession]
----
❯ nerdctl run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep '^NAME' /etc/os-release
NAME="SLES"
----

{{< /tab >}} {{< /tabs >}}

Alternatively, you can use SLE BCI in a `Dockerfile` as follows:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4
RUN zypper -n in python3 && \
    echo "Hello Green World!" > index.html
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/python3", "-m", "http.server"]
EXPOSE 8000
----

You can then build container images using your favorite container
runtime:

{{< tabs "build_example_dockerfile">}} {{< tab "Docker">}}

[source,ShellSession]
----
❯ docker build .
