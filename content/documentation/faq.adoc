== What are the SUSE Linux Base Container Images?

SUSE Linux Base Container Images (SUSE Linux BCI) provides a set of container images that are truly open, flexible and secure. Available for immediate use by developers, integrators and operators are container images based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES). SUSE Linux BCI includes general-purpose container images, development tools and applications.

== Is SUSE Linux BCI free to use?

Yes. SUSE Linux BCI is free to use and redistribute in accordance with the https://www.suse.com/licensing/eula/#bci[SUSE Linux BCI EULA].

== Where can I find SUSE Linux BCI?

The container images are available on the https://registry.suse.com/[SUSE Container Registry].

== What is included in SUSE Linux BCI?

Leveraging SUSE's industry-leading build pipeline, SUSE Linux BCI provides a set of container images where all binaries are built and maintained by SUSE, drawing directly from the trusted SLES codebase.

Base containers come in several flavors. Choose the BCI Micro image for a minimal footprint or the BCI Base image with full package-management tools. Expand the container images easily using thousands of packages from the <<free-bci-repo, free BCI repository>>.

Language containers are available as a base environment for development and deployment. Use programming languages such as C++, Go, Java (OpenJDK), .NETfootnote:[Available in Tech Preview, .NET binaries provided and maintained by Microsoft.], Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby and Rust.

Application containers provide ready-to-use databases, tools and more. Use applications such as 389 Directory Server, Cosign, Git, Helm, MariaDB, Nginx, Performance Co-Pilot, PostgreSQL, RMT and Valkey.

== What is the difference between SUSE Linux BCI Base, Minimal, Micro and BusyBox?

The SUSE Linux BCI Base container has Zypper and access to the <<free-bci-repo, free BCI repository>>. This allows you to install any packages from the available repositories.

The SUSE Linux BCI Minimal container has RPM but does not include Zypper. It is an image designed for deployment scenarios where you copy the final artifacts to it.

The SUSE Linux BCI Micro container does not include Zypper and RPM. It is similar to BCI Minimal but designed for the deployment of static binaries.

The SUSE Linux BCI BusyBox container has no GPLv3-licensed software, Zypper, or RPM. It is comparable to BCI Micro, but it replaces the GNU Coreutils with BusyBox tools.

== What is the free BCI repository?
[[free-bci-repo]]
The free BCI repository is a repository with packages that are free to use and redistribute, subject to the terms of the https://www.suse.com/licensing/eula/#bci[SUSE Linux BCI EULA].

All container images with Zypper include the free BCI repositories pre-configured.

== What packages and libraries can I use to expand SUSE Linux BCI?

The container images that include Zypper have access to the <<free-bci-repo, free BCI repository>>. This repository contains thousands of SUSE-supported packages. SUSE will support these packages when the container is running on a SUSE host with the appropriate subscription.

You are also free to configure repositories from openSUSE Leap or other compatible sources.

== What are some use cases for SUSE Linux BCI?

SUSE Linux BCI provides a stable, secure and open ecosystem for developing and deploying applications. SUSE Linux BCI leverages the experience, stability and security of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

SUSE Linux BCI is suitable for different use cases:

* SUSE Rancher
** Enable Rancher to build using stable, reliable, secure and certified enterprise components.
** Leverage SUSE's in-house OS knowledge while containerizing applications.
** Easy migration path from OS-based applications to containerized applications.
* Developers
** Avoid vendor lock-in.
** Deploy to any Linux host.
** Freely redistributable.
** Suitable for development, testing and production environments.
* Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
** Containerize applications using a stable, reliable, secure and certified enterprise OS.
** Leverage SUSE security and supply chain.
** Run applications on various hosts.

== Why did SUSE create SUSE Linux BCI?

SUSE created SUSE Linux BCI to provide truly open, flexible and secure container images that developers and integrators can use without the vendor lock-in of alternative offerings.

== On which hardware platforms is SUSE Linux BCI available?
