There are a couple different recommended methods to work with the Go BCI.
Don’t Ship The Compiler Go is a compiled language producing a binary as the end result. That means the compiler does not need to be shipped as part of the images that are distributed. Instead, it is recommended that the Go image is used as the builder image only.</description></item><item><title>Building Container Images based on SLE BCI</title><link>/guides/building-on-top-of-bci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/building-on-top-of-bci/</guid><description>Many tools for building container images exist in the ecosystem and our Base Container Images can be used by all of them. This guide summarizes the most important ones for our users:
Locally using docker, podman, or nerdctl
Docker or Podman in the Open Build Service
Kiwi in the Open Build Service
Using docker, podman and nerdctl The SLE Base Container Images are OCI compliant images and can thus be used without any modifications in your Dockerfile.</description></item><item><title>How To Use BCIs As VScode Development Containers</title><link>/guides/vscode-dev-containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/vscode-dev-containers/</guid><description>VS Code with the source mounted in a Development Container. The open terminal is a console within the container. Visual Studio Code has a feature called Development Containers. This is part of the built-in functionality to work with remote containers. The SLE Language Stack BCIs make a great choice to use as a development environment.
Why Use The SLE BCI In Development Containers There are two reasons the BCI language stack containers are useful for development.</description></item><item><title>How to use container-suseconnect</title><link>/guides/container-suseconnect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/container-suseconnect/</guid><description>What is container-suseconnect? container-suseconnect is a plugin available in all Base Container Images that ship with Zypper. When the plugin finds the host’s SUSE Linux Enterprise Server registration credentials, it uses them to give the container access the SUSE Linux Enterprise repositories. This includes additional modules and previous package versions that are not part of the free SLE_BCI repository.
How to use container-suseconnect If you are running a registered SLES system with Docker, container-suseconnect automatically detects and uses the subscription, without requiring any action on your part.</description></item><item><title>Using SLE BCI</title><link>/guides/using-sle-bci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/using-sle-bci/</guid><description>Package manager The default package manager in SUSE Linux Enterprise is Zypper. Similar to APT in Debian and APK in Alpine Linux, Zypper offers a command-line interface for all package management tasks. Below is brief overview of commonly used container-related Zypper commands.
Install packages zypper --non-interactive install $PACKAGE_NAME Add a repository zypper --non-interactive addrepo $REPOSITORY_URL; zypper --non-interactive refresh Update all packages zypper --non-interactive update Remove a package zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps $PACKAGE_NAME the --clean-deps flag ensures that no longer required dependencies are removed as well</description></item><item><title>Verify SLE Base Container Images With Cosign</title><link>/guides/verify-with-cosign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/verify-with-cosign/</guid><description>SUSE has SLE Base Container Images (BCI) that are great to use in workflows and as a based under your applications. One of the big reasons I like these images is that they are constantly updated with fixes for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). SUSE stays on top of this and takes security seriously.
For example, prior to writing this post I used Trivy to scan the Go image:</description></item></channel></rss>
