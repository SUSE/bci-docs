The open terminal is a console within the container. Visual Studio Code has a feature called Development Containers. This is part of the built-in functionality to work with remote containers. The SLE Language Stack BCIs make a great choice to use as a development environment.

Install packages zypper --non-interactive install $PACKAGE_NAME Add a repository zypper --non-interactive addrepo $REPOSITORY_URL; zypper --non-interactive refresh Update all packages zypper --non-interactive update Remove a package zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps $PACKAGE_NAME the --clean-deps flag ensures that no longer required dependencies are removed as well</description></item><item><title>Verify SLE Base Container Images With Cosign</title><link>/guides/verify-with-cosign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/verify-with-cosign/</guid><description>SUSE has SLE Base Container Images (BCI) that are great to use in workflows and as a based under your applications. One of the big reasons I like these images is that they are constantly updated with fixes for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). SUSE stays on top of this and takes security seriously.
For example, prior to writing this post I used Trivy to scan the Go image:</description></item></channel></rss>
