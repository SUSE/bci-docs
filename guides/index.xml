Background The SLE BCI Micro and Minimal images are tailored towards providing a small footprint and thus do not ship the useradd binary. While this reduces the image size, creating new users inside containers based on BCI Micro or Minimal involves a few additional steps.</description></item><item><title>Building and Deploying Go Applications</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/use-with-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/use-with-golang/</guid><description>There is a SLE BCI that can be used with the Go programming language. There are a couple different recommended methods to work with the Go SLE BCI.
Don’t Ship The Compiler Go is a compiled language producing a binary as the end result. That means the compiler does not need to be shipped as part of the images that are distributed. Instead, it is recommended that the Go image is used as the builder image only.</description></item><item><title>Deploy an Application using zypper</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/deploy-using-zypper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/deploy-using-zypper/</guid><description>Scope The purpose of this guide is to deploy an application or the dependencies of an application from rpms into a deployment image using the zypper package manager.
Using zypper’s custom root Zypper provides the --root flag to install packages into a custom root and not use /. We can leverage this feature to install a package including all of its dependencies into a custom root and then copy this directory into a deployment image.</description></item><item><title>How to build a distroless image using SLE BCI</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/building-a-distroless-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/building-a-distroless-image/</guid><description>What is a distroless image? Distroless images are stripped down container images, where the underlying Linux distribution is reduced to the bare minimum. A distroless image normally contains only certificates and specific core libraries, and it does not include a shell or utilities like cat or ls.
The advantages of distroless images include smaller size and potentially fewer vulnerabilities.
The major disadvantage is the difficulty of debugging a containerized application, as the container image does not provide any debugging tools and may even lack tools to read log files.</description></item><item><title>How to use container-suseconnect</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/container-suseconnect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/container-suseconnect/</guid><description>What is container-suseconnect? container-suseconnect is a plugin available in all Base Container Images that ship with Zypper. When the plugin detects the host’s SUSE Linux Enterprise Server registration credentials, it uses them to give the container access the SUSE Linux Enterprise repositories. This includes additional modules and previous package versions that are not part of the free SLE_BCI repository.
How to use container-suseconnect If you are running a registered SLES system with Docker, container-suseconnect automatically detects and uses the subscription, without requiring any action on your part.</description></item><item><title>How To Use SLE BCIs As VScode Development Containers</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/vscode-dev-containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/vscode-dev-containers/</guid><description>VS Code with the source mounted in a Development Container. The open terminal is a console within the container. Visual Studio Code has a feature called Development Containers. This is part of the built-in functionality to work with remote containers. The Language Stack SLE BCIs make a great choice to use as a development environment.
Why Use The SLE BCI In Development Containers There are two reasons the BCI language stack containers are useful for development.</description></item><item><title>Launch Containers with Podman and Systemd</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/podman-generate-systemd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/podman-generate-systemd/</guid><description>Local Container Orchestration A container runtime makes it easy to launch an application distributed as a single container. But things get more complicated when you need to run applications consisting of multiple containers, or when it’s necessary to start the applications automatically on system boot and restart them after they crash. While container orchestration tools like Kubernetes are designed for that exact purpose, they are intended to be used for highly distributed and scalable systems with hundreds of nodes, and not for a single machine.</description></item><item><title>Using SLE BCI</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/using-sle-bci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/using-sle-bci/</guid><description>Package manager The default package manager in SUSE Linux Enterprise is Zypper. Similar to APT in Debian and APK in Alpine Linux, Zypper offers a command-line interface for all package management tasks. Below is brief overview of commonly used container-related Zypper commands.
Install packages zypper --non-interactive install $PACKAGE_NAME Add a repository zypper --non-interactive addrepo $REPOSITORY_URL; zypper --non-interactive refresh Update all packages zypper --non-interactive update Remove a package zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps $PACKAGE_NAME the --clean-deps flag ensures that no longer required dependencies are removed as well</description></item><item><title>Verify SLE Base Container Images</title><link>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/verify-sle-bci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/verify-sle-bci/</guid><description>Introduction Verifying container images allows you to confirm their provenance, thus ensuring the supply chain security. This document demonstrates how to verify container images using Cosign and how to integrate the verification step into your Podman installation.
Verifying SLE BCI with Cosign To verify a SLE BCI image, run Cosign in the container. The command below fetches the signing key from the SUSE server and uses it to verify the latest BCI-Base container image.</description></item></channel></rss>
